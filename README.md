# Dataset-Friction-Damper-with-Backlash

This dataset comes from tests of the banded rotary friction device (BRFD), which exhibits hysteretic and backlash effects. 

## Device and Data
The BRFD is a semi-active friction damper [1,2]. The device has heightened applicability compared to other damping
technologies due to its mechanical robustness,
technological simplicity, and high damping
performance.

Characterization datasets were performed by moving the damper under a sinusoidal displacement as shown below. The wind profile tests were performed in a hybrid test where displacement from a simulated structure under wind displacement was fed into the damper. This test was performed in real-time so that reactions from the damper were captured and used in the structure simulation.
